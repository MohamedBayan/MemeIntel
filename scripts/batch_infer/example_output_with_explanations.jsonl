The text is sarcastic, calling the person who deducts 40 marks 'mentally challenged' ('مين المتخلف'). The visual elements, including casual clothing and a TV interview setting, reinforce the informal and relatable tone. The laughing emojis amplify the humor and emotional appeal, encouraging viewers to align with the critique. This combination of humor and ridicule is a classic propaganda technique to influence opinions on generational differences."}
